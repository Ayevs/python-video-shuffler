Small python app to shuffle the frames of multiple videos.

Take video 1 and video 2 then take each frame and shuffle them one after the other.
Frame 1 from video 1 and frame 2 from video 2, and repeat untill exhausted.

This then outputs to a single mp4 of chosen fps rate and can be used for whatever you might need it for.

personally I created to test with ai interpolation to see what things might come out of it.
